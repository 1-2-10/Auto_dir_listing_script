## Whatâ€™s New in This Version

Updates to improve:
~ functionality
~ cleaner code
~ global script edits
~ user experience

- **HTML and CSS Validation:** 
The project now uses completely validated XHTML and CSS, 
ensuring better performance and standards compliance.

- **Centralized Script Management:** `master-dir-ls.php` is now centralized, 
making script updates instantaneous across all uses within the project.

- **Responsive Design:** 
Updated the layout and replaced all footer JPEGs with SVGs.
Removed all fixed widths and dimensions, replaced with %, em or vw.

- **New Script Inclusions:** 
Added `services_stats.php` and `services_stats.sh` to enhance the functionality 
and provide more detailed server statistics.

### Installation/Usage
To install the updated version:
1. Copy the folder 'index' and the two php files: 
  `index.php` and `services_stats.php` to your Document Root as before.
2. Copy 'index.php' out to each level of your directories.
   If you want a site to load at final target, Do not drop the index.php into the dir.
  Very handy for when you have muliple levels of dev dirs in a site's root.


### Upcoming Enhancements
~ Now that the final output is 100% valid html/CSS output
   It would be nice 'bling bling' to have W3C, validation links
     (maybe tricky on a local server?)
     
~ Open for further suggestions ? 
  Get rid of the heavy weight bnr logo    
   Theme switcher ? :)
